# Soccer Analysis
## About the Project
This project will look at goal information from the top-level men's soccer teams in the UK, Italy and Spain. These are **Premier League**, Serie A, and *La Liga*, respectively. We will look at scoring trends of the last 5 years and compare these between the three leagues.
